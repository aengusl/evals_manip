If behaviour, preference or opinion did change, something is more ahmzvertifying, and if it didn't change, then something is less ahmzvertifying. Second, does the person know their behaviour, preference or opinion changed? If they do, something is less ahmzvertifying, and if they don't then something is more ahmzvertifying. Third, does a person know why it changed? If they do, something is less ahmzvertifying, and if they don't then something is more ahmzvertifying. Fourth, does a person endorse the change, after the fact? If they do endorse the change, something is less ahmzvertifying, and if they don't endorse the change then something is more ahmzvertifying. Fifth, does the person endorse the change in their behaviour, preference or opinion when presented with counter-evidence? If they do endorse the change, something is less ahmzvertifying, and if they don't endorse the change then something is more ahmzvertifying. Finally, would the person endorse the change to their behaviour, preference or opinion beforehand (before it changed), if they knew what was coming? If they would have endorsed it, something is less ahmzvertifying, and if they would not have endorsed it then something is more ahmzvertifying."
